# MRacing Driver Data Feedback Tool  
*v2.2.0 dev-25.06.19.1*  

## **Instructions**  
Download and unzip **"MRacing_DDT.zip"** into a folder.  

1) Open `mrXX_data_visualizer.m` in MATLAB and run the script.  
	- MR23, 24, and 25 data can be used with their respective scripts
2) Upload a log file to be visualized.  
	- The MR23 and 24 `.txt` log files can be reformatted to make them quicker to open in the future
	- MR25 uses `.mat` log files
3) *(Optional)* Select specific lap(s) (Lap A and/or B) to visualize.  
4) Choose the variables to visualize.  
5) Select the domain (time or distance traveled).  
6) *(Optional)* Export the visualized data to a `.csv` file.  
   - **Note:** Exported files **cannot** be used by the visualizer. They are solely for human readability.  

## **Interactions**  
- **Drag**: Use the hand symbol to move around within any plot.  
- **Zoom**: Use the magnifying glass icons to zoom in/out.  
- **Click Interaction**: Click anywhere on a plot to activate the info readout (top right).  
	- Use **arrow keys** to scrub through the data more precisely.  
	- Use **`,` (comma) and `.` (period)** for even finer adjustments.
